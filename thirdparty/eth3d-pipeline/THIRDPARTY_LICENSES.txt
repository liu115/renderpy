                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions.

    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.

    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".

    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.

    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

    4. Combined Works.

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

    d) Do one of the following:

        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.

        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
        Version.

    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
    for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
    conveyed under the terms of this License.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.


  ========================================================================

  ( The following exception for templates is taken from the Qt project )

  Digia Qt LGPL Exception version 1.1

  As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License version
  2.1, the object code form of a "work that uses the Library" may incorporate
  material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may distribute
  such object code under terms of your choice, provided that:
      (i)   the header files of the Library have not been modified; and 
      (ii)  the incorporated material is limited to numerical parameters, data
            structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and
            templates; and
      (iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General
            Public License version 2.1.

  Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the Library,
  provided that such modification does not involve copying material from the
  Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is
  limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data structure layouts;
  (iii) accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of
  five lines or less in length.

  Furthermore, you are not required to apply this additional permission to a
  modified version of the Library.

This program uses libigl, which is licensed as follows. Only the main MPL2
parts are used:

  Libigl is primarily licensed under MPL2
    - http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
    - http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

  All `.h` and `.cpp` _files_ directly in `include/igl` (but not necessarily in
  sub-directories) are subject only to the terms of the MPL2; they should not
  include any code that is covered by other/less-permissive licenses.

  The `.h` and `.cpp` _files_ in sub-directories of `include/igl` allow libigl to
  integrate with external third-party libraries (e.g., those in `external/`) and
  are subject to the MPL2, _**and**_ also the terms of licenses of the
  corresponding external library.  The licenses used by these libraries fall under
  three categories:

  - common "free, non-copyleft licenses" (such as zlib, BSD, MIT, and public
    domain)
    - `include/igl/anttweakbar`
    - `include/igl/embree`
    - `include/igl/opengl`
    - `include/igl/opengl/glfw`
    - `include/igl/opengl2`
    - `include/igl/png`
    - `include/igl/viewer`
    - `include/igl/xml`
  - common "copyleft" licences (such as GPL, LGPL, and AGPL)
    - `include/igl/copyleft`
    - `include/igl/copyleft/cgal`
    - `include/igl/copyleft/comiso`
    - `include/igl/copyleft/cork`
    - `include/igl/copyleft/tetgen`
  - other "uncommon" licenses or commercial software
    - `include/igl/lim`
    - `include/igl/matlab`
    - `include/igl/mosek`
    - `include/igl/triangle`

  The Libigl code that interfaces with "copyleft" libraries is in
  `include/igl/copyleft`.  Only include these headers if you are accept the
  licensing terms of the corresponding external library.  For example, using
  `include/igl/copyleft/tetgen` requires that you accept the terms of the AGPLv3.
